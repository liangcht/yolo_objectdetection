Introduction

Utilities to create create, explore, and train objectdetection taxonomies.

Installation
============

    To build the extensions and *install* the `mmod` and `mtorch` packages:

    ```
    python setup.py develop
    ```
    With `develop` you do not need to call the above again when changing `.py` 
    files. But if you change a cpp extension you will have to call this again to build. 
    If you do not want to develop the package and just want to install: 
    ```
    python setup.py install
    ```
    For philly, you can `install` only the cpp extensions inside your docker, and then call the scripts.
    All scripts (that have `main`) append the parent directory to the `sys.path` and can be run without installation.
